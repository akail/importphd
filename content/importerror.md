If ony it were that easy to get a PhD!  So, you've somehow wandered over to
this blog and I would like to personally welcome you here.  This is going to be
a documentation of my journey to earn a PhD while also working full time. So how about a little
bit about me?  I graduated from the University of Tennessee in 2011 and 2013 with a Bachelor and Masters degree
in Aerospace engineering.  Currently I'm a Senior Scientist at Savannah River National 
Laboratory in South Carolina where I am a jack of all trades in the computing group.

So now that brings us to the matter at hand. I'm starting a PhD after having worked at a National Lab for
almost 5 years.  Why?  I keep asking myself that same question everytime I think about the start
of classes in a few weeks.  Its been on my mind for a while now and was a little bit when I was finishing
up my Masters.  At the time I was definitely not ready to continue my education from a maturity
and work ethic standpoint, and thankfully my advisor made sure I knew that. I also had no idea what
degree I would like to pursue or what I was even doing with my career.  I was an Aerospace Engineer who
realized he was far more interested in programming and computing than building rockets and plane s

tracking my progress
have a little fun
Talk about various things with my phd including coursework.  Big python guy and It looks like I will doing
some java work.  Interested in possibly rewriting some things into python or other languages as a challenge to myself
