  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As I mentioned in the first blog post, there are a few reason I decided to write this blog.</p>
<h1>Practice</h1>
<p>This is a good opportunity for practice in writing. Yes, I know its a blog and not papers or publications.
Its still writing, and sometimes it may become technical.  That is my hope at least.  And to be perfectly honest
I am a terrible writer so I need all the practive I can get.</p>
<h1>Focus</h1>
<p>In the past I have tried several times to start a blog of some sort.  I remember I attempted one during
graduage school and wrote briefly about some random conference I attended. I quickly forgot about it. It however 
resurface when I interviewed at my current job and one of the interviewers had apparently google searched me
and found the blog with its single post. Quite embarassing actually. Still not sure where that page is now.</p>
<p>Now that I have a focus for the next few years I feel inclined to write something with meaning.</p>
<h1>Fear</h1>
<p>So, the main catalyst of this blog started a few weeks ago when I had a small panic
attach while at work.  I was in contact with my advisor to discuss my scheduling for
my first semester. I took a few minutes to look around at what people were saying about
going back to get a PhD while also working full-time.</p>
<p>Some things I found were not so encouragin.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-do-PhD-while-working">Is it possible to do a Phd while working</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some a little more encouraging</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/8747/is-it-possible-to-work-full-time-and-complete-a-phd">Is it possible to work full time and complete a phd</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And some that show others doing the same thing</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://womenincoastal.org/youre-doing-a-phd-part-time-while-working-full-time-are-you-insane/">Are you insane?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After reading a few of these I began to question my decision to do this.  It wasn't too late. I could
step back and let the professors know that I wasn't willing to commit and couldn't do it.  That's not what I
did though.  A serious panic started to seep into my mind and I found myself frozen
at my desk.</p>
<p><img alt="no body panic" src="https://importphd.com/images/sheldon-hyperventilate.gif"></p>
<p>After sitting in my chair for several minutes, I closes all the browser tabs open and took a deep breath. Also made
sure to text my wife to let her know as these things don't usually get to me.  So why the panic?  Well, this is a huge commitment
to make and I really do enjoy my free time to pursue some of my hobbies, spend time with friends and family, and workout.
What am I willing to sacrifice or a peace of paper and a title?</p>
<p>But here's the thing I keep reminding myself... I coasted through most of college, even my Masters, without giving 100%.
What would happen if I actually focused on what I was doing. It also helps that I have lots of support, both from my family and also from work.
I am lucky that I have a flexible job with good working hours and management that is in full support. I know its doable and I want do so.</p>
<p>Now how did that lead to a blog?  Well, one of the many articles I read about keeping up your motivation
during a PhD program suggested writing a blog. After a bit of thinking, I figured that was a good idea.
Especially if I am to make it through the <a href="http://juliopeironcely.com/archives/5-phases-of-phd-motivation-explained-the-roller-coaster-curve.html">Crisis of Meaning</a>
in the next several years.  Plus, it holds me accountable and by sharing my experience will help others who are
also working full time. </p>
<p>So, I have some goals now for my PhD. Some are my minimum expectations and some are moonshot goals. I am focused and ready
to go.</p>
